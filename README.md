# Cslox 
Implementation of jlox programming language from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) in C#
## Note 
This implementation is not exactly the same as the original implementation from the book. \
Throughout the codebase I implemented different ideas that I thought were suitable. \
For example, [AST-like structure for generating actual expression ASTs](https://github.com/sinexl/cslox/pull/1)
